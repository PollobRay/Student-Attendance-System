# Introduction
It is designed to contain attendance activities of students for teachers. This projects developed
in a JAVA platform is a replica I am familiar with and which I use quite often on a daily
basis. The only difference being that, this editor has been created using JAVA for the frontend interface.

# Interfaces of the Application
The interfaces is GUI form of the application.

   *<b>Conclusion:</b>
      We have implemented our project using object oriented concepts of Java language. Our
      honorable course teacher helped us to implement the project. We have learned about built in
      methods of java and NETBEANS (IDE) tools
